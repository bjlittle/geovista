    Content marked with 游뚾 indicates it's still under construction.


After a brief :ref:`overview <gv-overview>` and
:ref:`introduction <gv-quick-start>` to ``geovista``, hopefully you'll be keen
to explore and learn more.

The next step you choose to take is a personal one. It depends on how you
best learn given what you want to achieve.

To help us, help you, get the best out of ``geovista``, we've adopted the
`Di치taxis`_ framework to authoring our documentation.

It provides best practice advice on how to *organise* documentation in
a systematic way, with a focus on *content* and *style* that addresses the
four distinct needs of documentation users (see :numref:`di치taxis-figure`).

    Namely, acquiring *practical knowledge*, knowing *how*, through *working*:

    - **Tutorials** - A learning experience through practical lessons.
    - **How-To Guides** - Goal-focused practical guides on specific topics.

    Acquiring *theoretical knowledge*, knowing *that*, through *studying*:

    - **Explanation** - Achieve understanding through discussion and reflection.
    - **Reference** - Succinct factual information laid bare.


So if you learn by *doing*, then explore our *hands-on* themed lessons or
topic specific how-tos:
