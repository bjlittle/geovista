GeoVista Documentation
======================

Welcome to the GeoVista documentation!

.. margin:: **Under Construction**

    We've marked content with a ðŸš§ to indicate that it's still under construction.

We're busily crafting the structure and content of the documentation,
so it's likely that some material will change, move around or even be removed.  However,
the dust will settle and we'll eventually have a solid foundation to build upon.  Thanks
for your patience.

In the meantime, your feedback is important to us.  So feel free to submit a GitHub
`Issue <https://github.com/bjlittle/geovista/issues>`_  or
`Pull-Request <https://github.com/bjlittle/geovista/pulls>`_ to help us elevate our
documentation to the next level of awesome ðŸš€

Alternatively, if it's easier, come share with us over on our GitHub
`Discussions <https://github.com/bjlittle/geovista/discussions>`_.

We'd ðŸ’› to hear from you.
