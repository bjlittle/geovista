GeoVista Documentation
======================

.. note::
    :class: margin, dropdown, toggle-shown

    Content marked with ðŸš§ indicates it's still under construction.


Welcome to the ``geovista`` documentation!

``geovista`` is a pure `Python`_ package, built upon `PyVista`_ that offers
performant, publication quality 3-D cartographic rendering of Earth Science
data.

Our goal is to lower the bar for scientists, such that they can easily
analyze, visualize, and explore their rectilinear, curvilinear and
unstructured geospatial data interactively in 3-D.

We're still busy crafting the documentation, which is incomplete and liable
to change.  Thanks for your patience. However, your feedback is important
to us.  So feel free to submit a :fab:`github` `Issue`_  or
:fab:`github` `Pull-Request`_ to help elevate ``geovista`` to the next level
of awesome ðŸš€

Alternatively, come share with us over on our :fab:`github` `Discussions`_.
We'd ðŸ’š to hear from you.
