:fa:`compass-drafting` Specifications
=====================================

These are ``geovista``'s design specifications. Each is a living document,
maintained alongside the code it describes rather than archived behind it, so
read it as current. Where a specification and the code disagree, the
specification is what gets corrected, and the disagreement is worth reporting
as a defect in it.

The repository cites them by section. You will meet ``typing spec §3.2`` in
``pyproject.toml`` and ``docs spec §3.1`` in ``conf.py``, and each names a
section on one of the pages below. The prefix names the document, and it is
load-bearing: ``typing spec §3.2`` and ``docs spec §3.2`` are unrelated sections
of different documents.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 25 75

    * - Citation
      - Document
    * - ``docs spec §…``
      - :doc:`2026-10-06-published-specs-design`
    * - ``typing spec §…``
      - :doc:`2026-10-06-type-coverage-design`
    * - ``zlevel spec §…``
      - :doc:`2026-10-08-planar-zlevel-design`

A new specification chooses a prefix unique across this collection, declares it
in its own header banner, and joins the table above and the toctree.

.. note::

    The implementation plans derived from these specifications are tracked in
    the repository under `docs/src/developer/plans
    <https://github.com/bjlittle/geovista/tree/main/docs/src/developer/plans>`__,
    but deliberately not published here. A plan records what was intended
    before implementation and is not updated afterwards.
