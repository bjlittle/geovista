"""
GeoTIFF DEM
-----------

This example demonstrates how to render **Digital Elevation Model** (DEM) data
encoded in an `OGC GeoTIFF <https://www.ogc.org/standard/geotiff/>`_ as a
geolocated mesh.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

Creates an elevation warped mesh from GeoTIFF encoded DEM data.

The data is sourced from the **USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science**
(EROS) Archive, which is freely available from the
`USGS EarthExplorer <https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov>`_.

The Digital Elevation Model data was collected as part of the **Shuttle
Radar Topography Mission** (SRTM) aboard the space shuttle *Endeavour*,
February 11-22, 2000.

Endeavour orbited Earth 16 times each day during the 11-day mission,
completing 176 orbits. SRTM successfully collected radar data over 80%
of the Earth's land surface between 60Â°N and 56Â°S latitude with
data points posted every 1 arc-second (approximately 30 meters).

This SRTM sample is of *Mount Fuji*, one of Japan's
`Three Holy Mountains <https://blog.japanwondertravel.com/japans-three-sacred-mountains-14297>`_,
which is an active stratovolcano, located on the Japanese island of *HonshÅ«*.

The resulting mesh contains quad cells, with the elevation data located
on the mesh nodes/points.

The elevation data is used to extrude the mesh proportionally to reveal
the topography of Mount Fuji and its surrounding landscape.
