Earthquakes (Projected)
-----------------------

This example demonstrates how to render projected scalar points-of-interest.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

Creates a point cloud from a USGS earthquakes dataset.

The resulting render contains a point cloud of M2.5+ earthquakes along
with a Natural Earth base layer and Natural Earth coastlines. The point
cloud is also transformed to the Winkel I pseudo-cylindrical projection.

The earthquakes dataset is sourced from the
`USGS Earthquake Hazards Program <https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards>`_
and
`pre-processed <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviz/blob/main/examples/data/preprocessing/earthquake_data.py>`_
as part of this
`HoloViz Tutorial <https://holoviz.org/tutorial/Overview.html#the-holoviz-tutorial>`_.

=============  =============================================================  =========================
Magnitude      Earthquake Effects                                             Estimated Number per Year
=============  =============================================================  =========================
**<=2.5**      Usually not felt, but can be recorded by seismograph.          Millions
**2.5 - 5.4**  Often felt, but only causes minor damage.                      500,000
**5.5 - 6.0**  Slight damage to buildings and other structures.               350
**6.1 - 6.9**  May cause a lot of damage in very populated areas.             100
**7.0 - 7.9**  Major earthquake. Serious damage.                              10-15
**>=8.0**      Great earthquake. Can destroy communities near the epicenter.  One every year or two
