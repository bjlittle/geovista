This example demonstrates how to render an unstructured cloud mesh.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

Creates a mesh from 1-D latitude and longitude unstructured cell points.

The resulting mesh contains quad cells and is constructed from CF UGRID
unstructured cell points and connectivity.

It uses an unstructured Met Office high-resolution LFRic C768 cubed-sphere
of High Cloud Amount located on the mesh faces/cells.

Note that, a threshold is applied to remove low-valued Cloud Amount cells,
and a custom colormap is applied to the mesh to crop out unwanted darker
shades.

A Natural Earth base layer is also rendered along with Natural Earth
coastlines.
