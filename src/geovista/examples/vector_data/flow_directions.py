"""
Horizontal Flow
---------------

This example demonstrates how to display equal-sized flow direction arrows.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

The data source provides X and Y arrays containing plain longitude and
latitude values, with eastward- and northward-going flow components,
which is the most common case.

The sample flow data is actually provided in three separate surface-oriented
component arrays, 'U, V and W', i.e. eastward, northward and vertical components,
but we are only using the first two.  We use the :meth:`geovista.Transform.from_points`
method, passing the winds to the ``vectors`` keyword, producing a mesh of scattered
points with attached vectors.

The arrows themselves are created from this mesh via the
:meth:`pyvista.DataSetFilters.glyph` method.

In this example we display flow arrows of a fixed length, showing direction
only, but with a colour scale indicating magnitude.
