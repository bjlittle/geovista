3D Wind Arrows
--------------

This example demonstrates how to plot 3D wind vectors.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

The data source provides X and Y arrays containing plain longitude and
latitude values, which is the most common case.

The wind information is provided in three separate field arrays, 'U, V and W',
i.e. eastward, northward and vertical components.

These values are coded for each location (X, Y), measured relative to the longitude,
latitude and vertical directions at each point.

There is no connectivity provided, so each location has a vector and is independent of
the others.  Hence we use the ``geovista.Transform.from_points`` function, passing the
winds to the ``vectors`` keyword.

Here, we display 3-dimensional wind arrows.
We have amplified the "W" components by a considerable factor, which is typical since
vertical winds are generally much smaller in magnitude and otherwise tend to be not
very visible.
