"""
"True" Winds on a Foreign Grid
------------------------------

This example demonstrates how to display "true" winds, when attached to data points
given in a non-standard coordinate system.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

The example constructs some sample points on a polar stereographic grid, and assigns
synthetic vector values to them, representing wind data.  These data are presented as
"true" winds, i.e. northward and eastward components, so *not* related to the sample
grid.  This is a fairly typical real-world case.

In this case, the synthetic wind is a steady 4.0 ms-1 Eastward everywhere, so the
meaning is clearly seen.

We use the :meth:`geovista.bridge.Transform.from_points` method, passing the
winds to the ``vectors`` keyword, and specifying the different coordinate reference
systems of both the sample points (``crs``) and the vectors (``vectors_crs``).

Please refer to other code examples, e.g. `wind_arrows <./wind_arrows.html>`_ for more
details of the basic methods used.
