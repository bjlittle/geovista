Wind Arrows Plot
----------------

This example demonstrates how to display horizontal winds.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

The data source provides X and Y arrays containing plain longitude and
latitude values, which is the most common case.

The wind information is provided in three separate field arrays, 'U, V and W',
i.e. eastward, northward and vertical components.

These values are coded for each location (X, Y), measured relative to the longitude,
latitude and vertical directions at each point.

There is no connectivity provided, so each point is a separate location in a mesh of
scattered points, and each point has an associated vector value independent of
the others.  We use the :meth:`geovista.Transform.from_points` method, passing the
winds to the ``vectors`` keyword, producing a mesh of scattered points with attached
vectors.

The arrows themselves are created from this mesh via the
:meth:`pyvista.DataSetFilters.glyph` method.

Here we show just horizontal winds (U, V), which are usually of the most interest.
