3D Wind Arrows
--------------

This example demonstrates how to display wind vectors.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

The data source provides X and Y arrays containing plain longitude and
latitude values, which is the most common case.  

The wind information is provided in three separate field arrays, 'U, V and W'
 -- i.e. eastward, northward and vertical components.  
These values are coded for each location (X, Y), measured relative to the longitude,
latitude and vertical directions at each point.

There is no connectivity provided, so each location has a vector and is independent of
the others.  Hence we use the `geovista.Transform.from_points` function, passing the
winds to the `vectors` keyword. 

Initially, we can just show the horizontal winds, as this easier to interprt
We scale up the 'W' values, since vertical winds are typically much smaller than
horizontal.  Coastlines and a base layer are also added for ease of viewing.
