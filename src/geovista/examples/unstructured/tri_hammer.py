"""
WW3 Triangular Mesh (Projected)
-------------------------------

This example demonstrates how to render a projected unstructured triangular mesh.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

Creates a mesh from 1-D latitude and longitude unstructured points and connectivity.
o
The resulting mesh contains triangular cells. The connectivity is required to
construct the cells by indexing into the unstructured points.

WAVEWATCH III (WW3) sea surface wave significant height data is located on
mesh nodes/points, which are then interpolated across the mesh faces/cells.

A Natural Earth base layer is rendered along with Natural Earth coastlines,
and the mesh is also transformed to the Hammer & Eckert-Greifendorff
azimuthal projection.
