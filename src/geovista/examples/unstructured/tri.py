"""
WW3 Triangular Mesh
-------------------

This example demonstrates how to render an unstructured triangular mesh.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

Creates a mesh from 1-D latitude and longitude unstructured cell points.

The resulting mesh contains triangular cells. The connectivity is required to
construct the cells from the unstructured points.

It uses a WAVEWATCH III (WW3) unstructured triangular mesh sea surface
wave significant height data located on mesh nodes/points.

Note that, a threshold is also applied to remove land ``NaN`` cells, and a
Natural Earth base layer is rendered along with Natural Earth coastlines.
As data is located on the mesh nodes/points, these values are interpolated
across the mesh faces/cells.
