Wedge Extraction
----------------

This example demonstrates how to extract a region using a geodesic wedge manifold.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

This example uses an unstructured Met Office LFRic C48 cubed-sphere mesh of
surface altitude data.

Three separate geodesic wedge manifolds are constructed to extract the cells
of the mesh contained within the wedge. Each wedge uses a different enclosure
preference to extract the cells.

The regions extracted by each wedge are rendered along with the boundary where
the manifold intersects the surface of the mesh. A different colour is used
for each manifold boundary.

The **red boundary** contains only those cells where all points defining the
face of a cell are within the manifold.

The **purple boundary** contains only those cells where at least one point
that defines the face of the cell is within the manifold.

The **orange boundary** contains only those cells where the center of the
cell is within the manifold.

Each of the extracted mesh regions contain quad cells and are constructed from
CF UGRID unstructured cell points and connectivity. A Natural Earth base layer
is also rendered along with Natural Earth coastlines.
