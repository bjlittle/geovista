Panel Extraction
----------------

This example demonstrates how to extract a cubed-sphere panel using a geodesic manifold.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

This example uses an unstructured Met Office LFRic C48 cubed-sphere mesh of
surface temperature data located on the mesh faces/cells.

A geodesic cubed-sphere manifold is constructed for the Antarctic panel to
extract the cells of the surface temperature mesh contained within it. Note
that the extracted region contains only those cells where the center of the
cell is within the manifold.

The relationship between the manifold and the mesh is highlighted in the
first two subplots. Note that the boundary where the manifold intersects the
surface of the mesh being sampled is rendered in pink.

The cells extracted from the surface temperature mesh are rendered along with
a Natural Earth base layer and Natural Earth coastlines in the third subplot.
Again, the boundary of intersection between the manifold and mesh is rendered
in pink.
