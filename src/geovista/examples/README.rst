Examples Gallery
****************

This interactive gallery highlights the growing capabilities and
features of ``geovista``.

The gallery is generated from the ``geovista.examples``, which can also
be run from the command line::

  geovista examples --run all --verbose

.. only:: on_rtd

  .. note::
    Title text and graticule labels will **not** be rendered when viewing the
    documentation on ``ReadtheDocs``, as they are not supported in this
    headless environment.
