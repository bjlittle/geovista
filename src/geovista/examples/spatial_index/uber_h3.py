Uber H3 Spatial Index
---------------------

This example demonstrates the Uber ``H3`` hexagonal hierarchical spatial index.

ðŸ’¼ Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A spatial index is a structured collection of shapes that allows you to
approximately describe any region by simply taking a subset of shapes from that
index. The ``H3`` library, developed by Uber as an open source project, uses
hexagons to divide up the earth into cells. ``H3`` is hierarchical, meaning that
there are multiple resolutions of hexagonal meshes dividing the earth. Depending on
the resolution, these hexagonal cells range from **~1m^2** to **~4,000,000km^2**.

The coarsest mesh in ``H3``, the **base resolution mesh**, consists of
**110 hexagons** and **12 pentagons**, this is the starting point in a
hierarchical sequence of hexagonal meshes. Its structure is built on top of a
**base icosahedron**, the relationship between the **base icosahedron** and the
**base resolution mesh** informs the structure of the meshes of the further
meshes in the sequence.
Note that, a spherical surface cannot be tessellated solely with hexagons;
pentagons are also required.

The **12 vertices** of the underlying **base icosahedron** anchor the center of
the **12 pentagon cells**, around which the **110 hexagon cells** are tessellated
to form a fixed base mesh. Note that the center of all pentagons are located over
ocean, which suits the business model of Uber. Incidentally, these are the locations
of most projection distortion.

``H3`` is a hierarchical geospatial index. Each cell has a unique 64-bit
``H3Index`` that identifies its geospatial location and position in the ``H3``
hierarchy. Every parent hexagonal cell is subdivided into **7 child
hexagonal cells**, and every parent pentagon cell is subdivided into **6 child
cells**, precisely one of which is a pentagon.

From the coarsest base resolution, consisting of **122 cells**, there are
a further 15 increasingly higher resolution hierarchical child meshes.
The finest resolution mesh consists of **569,707,381,193,162 cells**, with
each resolution **always** containing **12 pentagon cells** centered over the
**base icosahedron** vertices.

The average area of a base (coarsest) resolution hexagonal polyhedron cell is
**~4,357,449 km^2**, whereas the average area of the finest resolution
hexagonal cell is **~0.895 m^2**.

Given a ``H3Index``, it is trivial to calculate the resolution, location
and neighbours of a cell, as well as all its child cells and parent cell.
Note that, the neighbours of a hexagon or a pentagon cell in a tessellated
mesh are equidistant, unlike a mesh consisting of triangular or rectangular
cells.

This example renders the ``H3`` base resolution mesh and the next 3 child
resolutions in the hierarchy, along with the base icosahedron and its
projected edges on the sphere.

Natural Earth coastlines are rendered to clarify geolocation, along with
a Natural Earth base layer.

The visibility of each actor, apart from the coastlines, can be toggled
interactively via checkbox buttons, allowing the viewer to easily explore
the relationship between the geometric objects rendered in the scene.
