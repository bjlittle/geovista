"""
Clouds Stratify
---------------

This example demonstrates how to render stratified cloud meshes.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

Creates meshes from 1-D latitude and longitude unstructured cell points.

The resulting meshes contain quad cells and are constructed from CF UGRID
unstructured cell points and connectivity.

It uses an unstructured Met Office high-resolution LFRic C768 cubed-sphere
of Low, Medium, High and Very High Cloud Amount located on the mesh
faces/cells.

Note that, a threshold is applied to remove low-valued Cloud Amount cells,
and a linear opacity transfer function is applied to a custom cropped
colormap for each mesh which gets lighter with increased altitude. This
combination renders a cloud-like effect.

A Natural Earth base layer is also rendered along with Natural Earth
coastlines.
