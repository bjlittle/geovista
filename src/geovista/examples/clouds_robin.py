Clouds (Projected)
------------------

This example demonstrates how to render projected stratified unstructured meshes.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^

Creates meshes from 1-D latitude and longitude unstructured cell points.

The resulting meshes contain quad cells and are constructed from CF UGRID
unstructured cell points and connectivity.

It uses an unstructured Met Office high-resolution LFRic C768 cubed-sphere
of low, medium, high and very high cloud amount located on the mesh
faces/cells.

Note that, a threshold is applied to remove lower cloud amount cells,
and a linear opacity transfer function is applied to a custom cropped
colormap of each cloud amount type mesh i.e., the colormaps get lighter
with increased altitude.

A Natural Earth base layer is also rendered along with Natural Earth
coastlines.
