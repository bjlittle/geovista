"""
LFRic Orography
---------------

This example demonstrates how to render a warped unstructured cubed-sphere mesh
and overlay a country border mesh that follows the surface topography.

ðŸ“‹ Summary
^^^^^^^^^^
Creates a mesh from 1-D latitude and longitude unstructured points and
connectivity.

It uses an unstructured Met Office LFRic C48 cubed-sphere of surface altitude
data.

The resulting mesh contains quad cells and is constructed from CF UGRID
unstructured cell points and connectivity.

Note that the scalar elevation values are located on the mesh nodes/points
which results in the rendered colours being interpolated across the cell faces.
A ``pyvista`` "warp" operation extrudes the mesh, using the same node altitude
values, to highlight the global surface topography.

The warp uses :meth:`~pyvista.PolyDataFilters.compute_normals` and
:meth:`~pyvista.DataSetFilters.warp_by_scalar`. See
`Computing Surface Normals <https://docs.pyvista.org/examples/01-filter/compute-normals>`_
for further details.

The country border mesh is created from the Natural Earth 110m Cultural
"admin_0_countries" dataset. This is draped over the LFRic orography mesh by
extruding the border lines into a vertical "wall" and calculating the
intersection between this and the LFRic mesh.

Warning: This intersection operation is computationally expensive and may
take some time to complete. It is recommended only for low resolution
natural earth datasets (i.e. 110m resolution).
