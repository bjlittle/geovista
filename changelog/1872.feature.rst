Added the ``bbox`` property to the :class:`geovista.geoplotter.GeoPlotterBase`
allowing users to consistently subset the render so that only geometries enclosed
by the bounding-box are rendered, including coastlines, base layers, meshes,
graticule meridians/parallels and their labels. Closes :issue:`1869`.
