Optimised :class:`geovista.geoplotter.GeoPlotterBase` manifold extraction
introduced by :pull:`1872` which is now specified through the generic ``manifold``
keyword argument instead of ``bbox``, and accessed through the
:attr:`~geovista.geoplotter.GeoPlotterBase.manifold` property. Additionally, empty
meshes may be added to a :class:`~geovista.geoplotter.GeoPlotter` without exception.
