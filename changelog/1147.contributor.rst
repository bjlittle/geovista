Adopted caching of :ref:`tutorial <tippy-gv-tutorials>` ``jupyter notebook`` outputs
when building the documentation. The cache will only be cleared with either
the ``make clean-cache`` or ``make clean-all`` commands. The ``make clean``
command will **not** clear the cache. Closes :issue:`1018`. (:user:`bjlittle`)
