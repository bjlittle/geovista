# ⚠️

This directory contains auto-generated `conda` specification (`*.txt`) environment files for the latest `python` distribution supported by `geovista`.

An equivalent explicit YAML (`*.yml`) file is also generated for each `python` distribution.

Please **do not** manually edit these files as they will be overwritten by the `ci-locks` GHA CI workflow.
